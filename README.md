This iteration is a proof of concept website. 

Currently using minimal-react-starter as the base. No complaints. 
<br>However as the project is starting to progress I may shift and start implementing some tdd.</br>

## What does it do?
## Wait and see ðŸ˜˜

## Installation Instructions:
1) clone the project
2) npm install
3) npm run start
4) open https://www.localhost:3000
5) check the terminal if you are already running on port 3000.
